"""NDJSON source adapter (RFC 002) — ingest a JSON-Lines spool of pre-extracted records.

For any pipeline that has already extracted and chunked content elsewhere and wants
to hand MemPalace ready-to-file records: each line of the spool is one record, filed
as one drawer. The adapter is byte-preserving — it stores ``content`` verbatim and
declares no transformations (the foundational promise; see ``CLAUDE.md`` "Verbatim
always"). It carries no opinion about *where* the records came from.

One NDJSON line is one record::

    {"content": "...", "source_file": "...", "metadata": {...}, "chunk_index": 0}

``content`` and ``source_file`` are required strings; ``metadata`` (flat scalars) and
``chunk_index`` (int) are optional. ``metadata`` passes through verbatim — producers
may attach any flat-scalar fields, opaque to this adapter. When ``chunk_index`` is
absent the adapter assigns a running per-``source_file`` ordinal so two records that
share a ``source_file`` never collide on the deterministic drawer id
(``sha256(source_file)_chunk``).

``SourceRef.local_path`` points at the spool file. The optional ``--wing`` routing
flag (``SourceRef.options['wing']``) fills the ``wing`` metadata key only where a
record left it unset (RFC 002 §2.5 — the record's own routing wins).
